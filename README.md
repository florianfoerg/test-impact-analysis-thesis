# Seminar Thesis Repository: Test Impact Analysis - Test Suite Optimization

This repository contains the resources for a seminar thesis on "Test Impact Analysis - Test Suite Optimization by Combining Modification-aware and Time-aware Selection using Integer Linear Programming". The seminar thesis focuses on improving software testing efficiency by optimizing test suite selection through a combination of modification-aware and time-aware techniques. This README file provides an overview of the directory structure and the contents of each directory.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Setup/`: A directory containing the scripts for data collection and visualization.
